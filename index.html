   <h1 id = "highlight">My profesional Journey</h1>
	
   <p>I began my tech career in 2013 when I was still in college. I joined a telecommunications company called 
	   Conference Technonolies Inc. At this company we installed and maintained Audio Visual Equipment in commercial buildings,
	   Houses of Worship and schools. I began as a technician helper and worked my way up to the technician lead position. I 
	   felt like I was not growing like I wanted to so I needed a change. That is when I joined the company I am in now - SKC
	   Communications.
   <p>At SKC Communications, i started as a video support technician. At this position, I managed, setup and troubleshot 
	   video conferencing equipment for our clients. In a month I moved over to the integration department as a service technician.
	   In this role, i serviced and troubleshot audio visual equipment at client sites as well as on the phone. In a couple of years,
	   I moved over to the programming department as an associate programmer. In this role I used audio visual proprietery software
	   to program the functionality of a room. Anything from projector control, lighting control, screen and shade control to 
	   building HVAC control.</p>  
   <p>All this is fun and challenging, but I now want to get more into programming languages that the software world uses. I have not 
	   decided whether to the the QA path, mobile development, front end or back end. When I get deeper into this, I will have a better 
	   understanding of what path I want to follow. Either path it will be an interesting journey.</p>

   <p>I could say that one of the most memorable places I have visited was Cairo, Egypt. My wife and I took that 3 day trip more than 
	   10 years ago. We did not know what to expect, and Cairo did not disappoint. From the dinner cruise to visiting the pyramids, it
	   was all fantastic, not to forget to mention the food and of course the people. We are planning on taking our kids to visit Cairo
	   in the near future.</p>

   <h3 id="Dubai">Dubai</h3>
   <p>Another one of my favorite but shortest trip was Dubai. We visited Dubai enroute to Nairobi, Kenya. Even thgh our stay was very short
      we got to enjoy the beautiful city thanks to our guide - my wife's sister. There is a lot to do in the dessert city and most of the 
      things were affordable.</p>
